__My conclusions__:
     <p> I would like to share my thoughts, impressions about learning material about git, Github. </p>
I’ve learned following new commands for me: __git reset__ and __git revert__. I understood the differences between them, I understood that git reset is designed to actually rewrite history, it actually deletes the committed commit and takes us to the last commit. In turn, git revert essentially creates a new commit with the reversed changes.  

Also new was the command __git commit –amend__ – for editing a comment in a commit; __git checkout -b new branch__ – to create a new branch, assign it a name and switch to it; __git branch -d new branch__ – delete a branch.
<p> New for me were - the ways of moving along the branch with <strong>^ - carriage</strong>, <strong>~ - tilde</strong>.</p>
<p>The most surprising (I can say I fell in love with it :heart_eyes:) were <strong>git rebase</strong>:heart:, <strong>git rebase -i</strong>:yellow_heart: and <strong>git cherry-pick</strong>:two_hearts:. I will definitely use them at work. I enjoyed working with these commands on the learnGitBranching course. </p>

The __git fetch__ and __git pull__ commands were also new. I learned that actually git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge commands. In addition, a new  for me was git fakeTeamWork.  

Thank you for the opportunity to practice well, even in game form. I made a workbook with conspectus
:pencil:, described the commands I had passed and studied. I will try to use them all in my work.  

In addition, I am learning __Markdown__ for myself, since I have not worked with such a markup language before.
<p>And, I advise to go through additional materials together with the main material, and not postpone it for later, because you can also find something useful for yourself. </p>
<p>Thank you, I will continue...:woman_technologist:</p>
