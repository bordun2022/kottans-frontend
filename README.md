__My conclusions__:
     <p> I would like to share my thoughts, impressions about learning material about git, Github. </p>
I’ve learned following new commands for me: __git reset__ and __git revert__. I understood the differences between them, I understood that git reset is designed to actually rewrite history, it actually deletes the committed commit and takes us to the last commit. In turn, git revert essentially creates a new commit with the reversed changes.  

Also new was the command __git commit –amend__ – for editing a comment in a commit; __git checkout -b new branch__ – to create a new branch, assign it a name and switch to it; __git branch -d new branch__ – delete a branch.
<p> New for me were - the ways of moving along the branch with <strong>^ - carriage</strong>, <strong>~ - tilde</strong>.</p>
<p>The most surprising (I can say I fell in love with it :heart_eyes:) were <strong>git rebase</strong>:heart:, <strong>git rebase -i</strong>:yellow_heart: and <strong>git cherry-pick</strong>:two_hearts:. I will definitely use them at work. I enjoyed working with these commands on the learnGitBranching course. </p>

The __git fetch__ and __git pull__ commands were also new. I learned that actually git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge commands. In addition, a new  for me was git fakeTeamWork.  

Thank you for the opportunity to practice well, even in game form. I made a workbook with conspectus
:pencil:, described the commands I had passed and studied. I will try to use them all in my work.  

In addition, I am learning __Markdown__ for myself, since I have not worked with such a markup language before.
<p>And, I advise to go through additional materials together with the main material, and not postpone it for later, because you can also find something useful for yourself. </p>
<p>Thank you, I will continue...:woman_technologist:</p>

#### 2. [Linux CLI and, HTTP](#linux-cli-and-http)
    - [x] 2.1. Course: Linux Survival
<p> I want to say a few words about the course <b>Linux Survival (4 modules)</b> :+1: </p>

I’ve got knowledge of basic commands in Linux such as: __«ls», «mkdir», «rmdir», «cd», «more», «pwd», «mv», «rm», «cp»__.

<p> New for me was that the <b>«rmdir»</b> command can only remove an empty directory. The commands: <b>«more», «pwd», «cp»</b> were unknown for me before </p>

<p>In module 2, I've learned about how provided the access with some actions in files of directory. I’ve learned  the <b>«chmod»</b> command. I’ve learned about the possibility to select all files in a directory using <b>«*»</b> or  e.g. files with -ing ending - <b>«ls *ing»</b> and so on.</p>
<p>The third module was the most difficult.:disappointed_relieved: I got knowledges about moving between files in the directory. How to get to the home folder, how to indicate that you are in the current folder. The <b>«find»</b> command was surprising. Quite useful and convenient thing, I will definitely use it at work.:+1:</p>
<p>The command <b>«cat» and «>» and «>>»</b> were new to me. Separately, I enjoyed the commands related to printing files. It was quite clear for me such as: <b>«lpr» (send to print), «lpq» (show the print queue), «lprm» (delete a file from printing).</b> I’ve learned how to bind with some printer through the command line.</p>
<p>In module 4, the <b>«kill»</b> command and the tougher <b>«kill -9»</b>  - for forced removal were the most surprising.
<p>In addition, the <b>«df»</b> command was new to get understanding how much space is left in the directory. I learned how to copy files from someone else's directory to my own using <b>«cp -r»</b>, and how to delete a directory with files using <b>«rm -r»</b>. New to me was the command called <b>«ps»</b> that checks the status of the program and the technical mark <b>«|»</b>. In addition, the <b>«grep»</b> command for finding every repetition of a word in a file was interesting for me.:+1::+1:</p> 

I believe that knowledge of Linux system commands will be quite necessary and useful in work :woman_technologist:
