__My conclusions__:
     <p> I would like to share my thoughts, impressions about learning material about git, Github. </p>
I’ve learned following new commands for me: __git reset__ and __git revert__. I understood the differences between them, I understood that git reset is designed to actually rewrite history, it actually deletes the committed commit and takes us to the last commit. In turn, git revert essentially creates a new commit with the reversed changes.  

Also new was the command __git commit –amend__ – for editing a comment in a commit; __git checkout -b new branch__ – to create a new branch, assign it a name and switch to it; __git branch -d new branch__ – delete a branch.
<p> New for me were - the ways of moving along the branch with <strong>^ - carriage</strong>, <strong>~ - tilde</strong>.</p>
<p>The most surprising (I can say I fell in love with it :heart_eyes:) were <strong>git rebase</strong>:heart:, <strong>git rebase -i</strong>:yellow_heart: and <strong>git cherry-pick</strong>:two_hearts:. I will definitely use them at work. I enjoyed working with these commands on the learnGitBranching course. </p>

The __git fetch__ and __git pull__ commands were also new. I learned that actually git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge commands. In addition, a new  for me was git fakeTeamWork.  

Thank you for the opportunity to practice well, even in game form. I made a workbook with conspectus
:pencil:, described the commands I had passed and studied. I will try to use them all in my work.  

In addition, I am learning __Markdown__ for myself, since I have not worked with such a markup language before.
<p>And, I advise to go through additional materials together with the main material, and not postpone it for later, because you can also find something useful for yourself. </p>
<p>Thank you, I will continue...:woman_technologist:</p>

<p> I want to say a few words about the course <b>Linux Survival (4 modules)</b> :+1: </p>

I’ve got knowledge of basic commands in Linux such as: __«ls», «mkdir», «rmdir», «cd», «more», «pwd», «mv», «rm», «cp»__.

<p> New for me was that the <b>«rmdir»</b> command can only remove an empty directory. The commands: <b>«more», «pwd», «cp»</b> were unknown for me before </p>

<p>In module 2, I've learned about how provided the access with some actions in files of directory. I’ve learned  the <b>«chmod»</b> command. I’ve learned about the possibility to select all files in a directory using <b>«*»</b> or  e.g. files with -ing ending - <b>«ls *ing»</b> and so on.</p>
<p>The third module was the most difficult.:disappointed_relieved: I got knowledges about moving between files in the directory. How to get to the home folder, how to indicate that you are in the current folder. The <b>«find»</b> command was surprising. Quite useful and convenient thing, I will definitely use it at work.:+1:</p>
<p>The command <b>«cat» and «>» and «>>»</b> were new to me. Separately, I enjoyed the commands related to printing files. It was quite clear for me such as: <b>«lpr» (send to print), «lpq» (show the print queue), «lprm» (delete a file from printing).</b> I’ve learned how to bind with some printer through the command line.</p>
<p>In module 4, the <b>«kill»</b> command and the tougher <b>«kill -9»</b>  - for forced removal were the most surprising.
<p>In addition, the <b>«df»</b> command was new to get understanding how much space is left in the directory. I learned how to copy files from someone else's directory to my own using <b>«cp -r»</b>, and how to delete a directory with files using <b>«rm -r»</b>. New to me was the command called <b>«ps»</b> that checks the status of the program and the technical mark <b>«|»</b>. In addition, the <b>«grep»</b> command for finding every repetition of a word in a file was interesting for me.:+1::+1:</p> 

I believe that knowledge of Linux system commands will be quite necessary and useful in work :woman_technologist:

- [x] 2.2. <b>Article: HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1</b> 

<p>In Article №1, I’ve learned that <b>HTTP</b> is a special protocol for delivering a document to a Web browser by a Web server. :computer::globe_with_meridians: Also <b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b> is used as the transport protocol. </p>
<p>What was new to me and what surprised me that the HTTP protocol is considered as stateless protocol, that why, it does not store information about the user's session; each data transfer is considered as a new session.</p>
<p>I also learned about the current version of this protocol, which is used nowadays, namely __HTTP/1.1__ </p>
<p>I’ve studied the structure of a URL, which consists of :one:protocol, :two:host, 	:three:port, 	:four:resource path, and :five:request.</p>
<p>I learned about the most frequently used __«GET»__ request method and about other methods such as <b>POST, PUT, DELETE</b> etc.</p>
<p>Totally new to me were the numerical responses from the server, some of them were known, like <b>200 OK</b> and <b>404 Not Found.</b> But the group of <b>301, 303 about moving the address, 401 about the need for authentication, 403 (denied access to the resource), 500 (internal server error), 503 about the impossibility of processing requests by the server for technical reasons or overload</b>, and others - were completely new to me.</p>
<p>Having gained knowledge about these types of responses, I can now easily apply them in my future work.</p>
<p>I learned about the availability of libraries and frameworks such as ExpressJS (for Node), Ruby on Rails and jQuery Ajax.</p>

- [x] 2.3. <b>Article: HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2</b>
<p>In Article №2,  interesting and new to me was that a frontend developer must have knowledge about server client <b>identification and authentication.</b> This goal is to track site or app traffic and regular user behavior patterns. I will use the acquired knowledge in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, it was new to me that there are several ways to get information about the user from the server, through <b>IP address, request headers, cookies:cookie: etc.</b> I’ve learned that cookies are the most popular and unobtrusive files, because it is necessary to get the user's prior approval for their use.</p>
<p>What surprised me was that HTTP with a secure connection is currently being used, namely HTTP<b><i>S</i></b> - <b>HTTP <i>Secure.</i></b> I checked my browser's own address bar and found <u>HTTPS protocol</u> there.:+1:</p>
